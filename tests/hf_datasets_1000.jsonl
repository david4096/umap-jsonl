Product Reviews) is one of Amazons iconic products. In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), amongst others. Accordingly, we are releasing this data to further research in multiple disciplines related to understanding customer product experiences. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews.\n\nOver 130+ million customer reviews are available to researchers as part of this release. The data is available in TSV files in the amazon-reviews-pds S3 bucket in AWS US East Region. Each line in the data files corresponds to an individual review (tab delimited, with no quote and escape characters).\n\nEach Dataset contains the following columns:\n\n- marketplace: 2 letter country code of the marketplace where the review was written.\n- customer_id: Random identifier that can be used to aggregate reviews written by a single author.\n- review_id: The unique ID of the review.\n- product_id: The unique Product ID the review pertains to.

To resolve the missing training data problem, we present a collection of\n∼ 5000 sentences to establish human-annotated standards for benchmarking\nalternative modeling techniques.\n\nThe objective of the phrase level annotation task was to classify each example\nsentence into a positive, negative or neutral category by considering only the\ninformation explicitly available in the given sentence. Since the study is\nfocused only on financial and economic domains, the annotators were asked to\nconsider the sentences from the view point of an investor only; i.e. whether\nthe news may have positive, negative or neutral influence on the stock price.\nAs a result, sentences which have a sentiment that is not relevant from an\neconomic or financial perspective are considered neutral.\n\nThis release of the financial phrase bank covers a collection of 4840\nsentences. The selected collection of phrases was annotated by 16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets. Three of the annotators\nwere researchers and the remaining 13 annotators were master’s students at\nAalto University School of Business with majors primarily in finance,\naccounting, and economics.\n\nGiven the large number of overlapping annotations (5 to 8 annotations per\nsentence), there are several ways to define a majority vote based gold\nstandard.

This dataset was originally col- lected for the DARPA-TIDES surprise-language con- test in 2002, later refined at IIIT Hyderabad and provided for the NLP Tools Contest at ICON 2008 (Venkatapathy, 2008).\n\nCommentaries by Daniel Pipes contain 322 articles in English written by a journalist Daniel Pipes and translated into Hindi.\n\nEMILLE. This corpus (Baker et al., 2002) consists of three components: monolingual, parallel and annotated corpora. There are fourteen monolingual sub- corpora, including both written and (for some lan- guages) spoken data for fourteen South Asian lan- guages. The EMILLE monolingual corpora contain in total 92,799,000 words (including 2,627,000 words of transcribed spoken data for Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu). The parallel corpus consists of 200,000 words of text in English and its accompanying translations into Hindi and other languages.\n\nSmaller datasets as collected by Bojar et al. (2010) include the corpus used at ACL 2005 (a subcorpus of EMILLE), a corpus of named entities from Wikipedia (crawled in 2009), and Agriculture domain parallel corpus.\n￼\nFor the current release, we are extending the parallel corpus using these sources:\nIntercorp (Čermák and Rosen,2012) is a large multilingual parallel corpus of 32 languages including Hindi. The central language used for alignment is Czech. Intercorp’s core texts amount to 202 million words. These core texts are most suitable for us because their sentence alignment is manually checked and therefore very reliable. They cover predominately short sto- ries and novels. There are seven Hindi texts in Inter- corp. Unfortunately, only for three of them the English translation is available; the other four are aligned only with Czech texts. The Hindi subcorpus of Intercorp contains 118,000 words in Hindi.\n\nTED talks 3 held in various languages, primarily English, are equipped with transcripts and these are translated into 102 languages. There are 179 talks for which Hindi translation is available.\n\nThe Indic multi-parallel corpus (Birch et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012) is a corpus of texts from Wikipedia translated from the respective Indian language into English by non-expert translators hired over Mechanical Turk. The quality is thus somewhat mixed in many respects starting from typesetting and punctuation over capi- talization, spelling, word choice to sentence structure. A little bit of control could be in principle obtained from the fact that every input sentence was translated 4 times. We used the 2012 release of the corpus.\n\nLaunchpad.net is a software collaboration platform that hosts many open-source projects and facilitates also collaborative localization of the tools. We downloaded all revisions of all the hosted projects and extracted the localization (.po) files.\n\nOther smaller datasets. This time, we added Wikipedia entities as crawled in 2013 (including any morphological variants of the named entitity that appears on the Hindi variant of the Wikipedia page) and words, word examples and quotes from the Shabdkosh online dictionary.", "disabled": false, "downloads": 20, "downloads_all_time": null, "gated": false, "key": "", "lastModified": "2022-03-02 23:29:22+00:00", "last_modified": "2022-03-02 23:29:22+00:00", "likes": 1, "paperswithcode_id": "hindencorp", "private": false, "sha": "62656da6951bc2f0749778a32389c6b7268d68ae", "siblings": null, "tags": ["task_categories:translation", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:crowdsourced", "language_creators:machine-generated", "multilinguality:translation", "source_datasets:original", "language:en", "language:hi", "license:cc-by-nc-sa-3.0", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "region:us"], "id": "pary/hind_encorp"}

The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is promising\nas SSL representations show competitive generalizability and accessibility\nacross SUPERB tasks.

The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is promising\nas SSL representations show competitive generalizability and accessibility\nacross SUPERB tasks. We release SUPERB as a challenge with a leaderboard and a\nbenchmark toolkit to fuel the research in representation learning and general\nspeech processing.\n\nNote that in order to limit the required storage for preparing this dataset, the\naudio is stored in the .flac format and is not converted to a float32 array.
